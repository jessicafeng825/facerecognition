# facerecognition
face recognition based on tensorflow and MTCNN and CNN/dataset:use CASIA webface/
use MTCNN to cut and filter the data set,
reference:Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878v1
use CNN to classify the faces
reference:FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832
and real-time recognition.
you can download the CASIA dataset in
